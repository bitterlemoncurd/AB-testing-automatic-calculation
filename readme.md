Development Testing Plan:

Done: Version 1. Automated testing of statistical significance of events: Bernoulli distribution.

Done: Version 2. Implemented multiple hypothesis testing, starting with the Holm-Bonferroni method.

Fix TBD: Combine the code for testing multiple hypotheses with the multiple hypothesis testing.

Version 3. Add Bayesian testing.

Version 4. Automated testing of statistical significance of revenue: bootstrap, chi-square distribution, Bernoulli * exponential?.

Version 5. All of the above is wrapped into a microservice, deployed in Docker, and deployed in Kubernetes.

Version 6. All of the above is tested on large numbers for the stability of results.

Version 7. Monitoring of metrics.
